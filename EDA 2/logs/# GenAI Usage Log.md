## Prompt 1: Designing an Automated EDA Pipeline

**Prompt:**
Help me design a Python system that can analyze any CSV dataset and automatically produce exploratory data analysis, including statistics, plots, and insights.

**Response Summary:**
The model suggested a generic EDA workflow:
- Load dataset
- Inspect structure and data types
- Compute descriptive statistics
- Create standard plots
- Write a human-readable summary

**What I Changed / Verified:**
- Implemented the pipeline fully in Python using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn
- Ensured the system works on large datasets (1M+ rows)
- Saved all outputs to files for reproducibility instead of printing only
- Ensured the system runs end-to-end from a single command

## Prompt 2: Handling Mixed Data Types and Data Quality

**Prompt:**
How can I automatically handle numeric vs categorical columns and detect data quality issues?

**Response Summary:**
The model recommended separating columns by inferred data type and performing basic quality checks such as missing values, duplicates, and constant columns.

**What I Changed / Verified:**
- Used pandas type inference and verified column classifications manually
- Computed missing value percentages explicitly in code
- Added duplicate row detection and high-missingness warnings
- Ensured the system still runs if a dataset lacks numeric or categorical columns

## Prompt 3: Computing Statistics and Outliers Safely

**Prompt:**
How can I compute numeric statistics and outliers without hardcoding assumptions?

**Response Summary:**
The model suggested computing quartiles and using the 1.5×IQR rule for outlier detection.

**What I Changed / Verified:**
- Implemented all statistics directly in pandas
- Verified min, max, mean, median, and IQR values against CSV outputs
- Ensured outlier counts are computed from actual data, not generated by the model
- Skipped columns with no valid numeric values

---

## Prompt 4: Generating Human-Readable Insights Without Hallucination

**Prompt:**
How can I generate insights using an LLM without hallucinating values?

**Response Summary:**
The model recommended computing all values first in code and then referencing those computed values in the report.

**What I Changed / Verified:**
- Insights in the report reference only computed statistics
- No numeric values are generated by the model
- Insights are based on column-specific results (ranges, frequencies, missingness)
- Verified insights against numeric_stats.csv and categorical_stats.csv

## Prompt 5: Report Generation and Visualization

**Prompt:**
How can I generate a concise EDA report with plots that is easy to submit?

**Response Summary:**
The model suggested generating a Markdown report and embedding saved plots.

**What I Changed / Verified:**
- Created a short, submission-ready report.md
- Embedded the four most important plots:
  - Histogram
  - Boxplot
  - Bar chart
  - Correlation heatmap
- Ensured plots are labeled and saved consistently
- Verified all plots exist before embedding

## Prompt 6: Converting the Report to PDF

**Prompt:**
How can I convert a Markdown EDA report into a PDF with embedded plots?

**Response Summary:**
The model suggested using Pandoc with LaTeX and controlling figure placement.

**What I Changed / Verified:**
- Added a Pandoc subprocess call to generate a PDF automatically
- Fixed relative image paths so plots embed correctly
- Adjusted Pandoc options to improve formatting and prevent line-breaking issues
- Verified the final PDF includes text and plots in the correct sections

---

## Prompt 7: Debugging Errors and Warnings

**Prompt:**
Why are my plots not embedding correctly in the PDF?

**Response Summary:**
The model explained Pandoc’s working directory and relative path behavior.

**What I Changed / Verified:**
- Updated the Pandoc call to run inside the output directory
- Confirmed plot filenames match Markdown references
- Re-ran the pipeline to verify warnings were resolved
